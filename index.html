              Recognizing that early experiences have profound effects on
              development and learning, Learning Tree Christian Academy sets as
              its vision a sincere effort to assist parents in providing a
              positive learning environment with opportunities for personal
              growth, helping their children build strong character traits that
              will serve them well in their youth as well as help them become
              responsible citizens as adults, contributing to the needs of our
              local, diverse community, state of Mississippi, and extending
              nationally and internationally as these children grow to make a
              sincere impact in our world.

            <p
              class="passion-description passion-description--margin-bottom-less"
            >
              Learning Tree Christian Academy focuses on the overall development
              of the whole person including social, emotional, physical,
              spiritual, creative, cognitive, and language development through a
              combination of student-led and teacher-directed learning
              activities. We meet these needs through a loving, Christian, and
              home-type environment. Although Learning Tree is a Christian-based
              program, there is no particular denominational influence. Learning
              Tree also prioritizes safety, cleanliness, and health.
            </p>
            <p class="passion-description">
              Developmentally-appropriate educational opportunities are provided
              daily, and we believe the children's enjoyment and learning
              success in early childhood and elementary school will enhance
              their desire to continuously learn in the future. Because we know
              that all children learn differently and at their own pace, LTCA
              strives to offer differentiated instruction to meet the student's
              individual learning needs. Since we believe young children learn
              through play and that play is an important vehicle for developing
              self-regulation and promotion language, cognition, and social
              competence, LTCA offers both indoor and outdoor fun opportunities
              that encourage "hands on" learning. Because we believe experience
              in the arts is an important part of a person's development, we
              offer art and music daily.

              a passion for learning that will last a lifetime. We want to
              assist our children at LTCA to develop at age-appropriate rates in
              the areas of social and emotional, cognitive, and physical and
              language development, as determined through Ages and Stages

              them better through daily conversations, scheduled meetings, and
              planned family events. We want our LTCA parents to meet with our
              administrator, directors, and teachers regularly to help us better
              plan for and meet the individual needs of each student including
              any cultural needs, while assisting with executing and evaluating
              any assessments. We want to provide opportunities for parents to
              volunteer in their child's classroom and at school-wide events,
              knowing children benefit from involvement of their parents, their
              first and best teachers.

                can be presented well in a large group setting. The teacher then

                instruction, increasing opportunities to provide differentiated
                instruction and help each child learn concepts. The teacher uses
                Abeka curriculum to present other learning activities such as
                recognizing and writing letters, learning the short and long
                vowel sounds, helping the students begin to read, forming
                numbers and counting objects, and learning colors and basic
                shapes.

                Our K-4 through Grade 3 children learn to read and master
                age-appropriate concepts. The students also learn through
                self-directed, student-led play. They enjoy centers within the
                room such as the reading corner and the math and science
                manipulatives section. They also develop hand-eye-coordination
                and thinking skills through puzzles and table games. Children
                especially like using their imagination and learning
                construction skills with the selection of building blocks and
                other STEM items. The outdoor playground provides the
                opportunity for children to exercise, play, learn, and enjoy
                games. For our younger children, the equipment includes
                foot-powered cars for motor skills. Balls, parachutes, jump
                ropes, etc. are available for active play. Children will also
                enjoy playhouses, as well as outdoor chalk centers for creative
                play and development of hand-eye coordination skills.
